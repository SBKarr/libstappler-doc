Suppose we have a translation\nmatrix T and a rotation matrix R. To first rotate an object around the origin\nand then translate it, you would multiply the two matrices as TR.\n\nLikewise, to first translate the object and then rotate it, you would do RT.\nSo generally, matrices must be multiplied in the reverse order in which you\nwant the transformations to take place (this also applies to\nthe scale, rotate, and translate methods below; these methods are convenience\nmethods for post-multiplying by a matrix representing a scale, rotation, or translation).\n\nIn the case of repeated local transformations (i.e. rotate around the Z-axis by 0.76 radians,\nthen translate by 2.1 along the X-axis, then ...), it is better to use the Transform class\n(which is optimized for that kind of usage).\n\n@see Transform\n",
